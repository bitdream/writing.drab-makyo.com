title: Disgusting

Dear someone who will never read this,

I don't know why you thought it was okay to call me disgusting to my face while we were lying in bed together, to explain to me that I was disingenuous because you had friends with real problems, but I guess that's all beside the point.  I just lay there, silently, and you eventually went to sleep and we never talked about it again.

I was silently agreeing with you (and, given that we no longer talk on your orders, I still am, in a way).  I feel disgusting every day, and I feel like a fake the whole time.  That's how this gender thing works, I guess.  All you did was point at it and name it for what it was.  That's not what made me upset.  What made me upset is that you were totally serious, calling your friend disgusting to their face.  It wasn't some sort of laugh it off, however bitterly, comment that could have turned into a discussion.  It was a sentence, a judgement.

Because there was no room for discussion on the matter, I kept silent on the whole thing.  You had some troubles and we talked about them, I had some troubles and disappeared for a month or two, it was just sort of how life worked as normal, for a while, but rather than greet me again when I started to come back from wherever I was, you just ignored me.  Pressing for an answer got me one-word replies, and I so I wrote you a letter and sent you a gift, apologizing for disappearing.  Someone else told me you were going to email me back, and sure enough, a week later, I got an email telling me that 'people go through hard times' and 'it's rough' and to 'just leave you alone.'  

I do my level best not to blame you for your choice.  You're free to do whatever you want, and it's sort of my duty as someone who tries to be a friend to do as you wish.  I understand how it seems like you had offended me - you had - but I thought that we had talked about it enough to make it not a big deal.  I understand how my disappearing was an indicator of how you had been treated here - though that was never my intention.  I understand that just leaving you alone might prove helpful to your state of mind - though I disagree with not having any options for redress in the future.  It's okay, I guess.  I understand where you're coming from.

So I let you destroy our friendship, and I guess now we all know why I feel disgusting all of the time.

All my best,

~M
