Hi!  Thanks for reading this.  After the success of last year's combined drive
on Twitter, and in memory of my pup Millie, I will be donating $1 to the [Humane
Society of the United States](http://www.humanesociety.org/) for every retweet
of [this status update on
twitter](https://twitter.com/drab_makyo/status/408284722972749824).  I will
donate no less than $500 (and, just to be safe, no more than $2000); this isn't
a popularity contest, just a fun way to help with giving for the holidays!

### Why?

I've got a lot of stuff.  *We* have a lot of stuff.  It's just part of the
accumulated past of more than two families.  The last thing we really need is
more *things*.  In that vein, and after the experience of donating to the ASPCA
last year, I've decided to repeat the experiment. 

Additionally, due to cancer and internal bleeding, [my dog Millie was put down
earlier this year](/posts/personal/2013/10/06/millie/).  Millie was adopted from
the Humane Society of Boulder after her previous owner had tried to make a
fighting dog of her.  Fed up with her inability to be anything but a sweetheart,
he kicked her and broke her back leg, which then healed improperly.  Even so,
she was a trooper, and followed my mom on hikes for years.  This is one small
thing I can do in her honor.

The Humane Society of the United States is [highly
